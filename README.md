# Flask Number Guessing Game

- This project is a simple number guessing game built using Flask. The goal is for the user to guess a random number between 0 and 9. The app provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It uses dynamic responses and fun GIFs to enhance the user experience.

### How It Works:
1. Home Route (/):
    - Displays a message asking the user to guess a number between 0 and 9.
    - Shows an introductory GIF.

2. Guess Route (/<int:guess>):
    - The user enters a guess in the URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/5).
    - The app compares the guess with a randomly generated number.
    - If the guess is too high, a red message and a corresponding GIF are shown.
    - If the guess is too low, a blue message and another GIF are displayed.
    - If the guess is correct, a green message and a celebratory GIF are shown.
